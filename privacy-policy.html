  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Effective date: April 22, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the <strong>MemePoster_Bot</strong> (“the Bot”) on Telegram handles user data.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>The Bot collects only the following data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Telegram chat ID</strong> – to know where to send responses</li>
    <li><strong>Telegram user ID</strong> – to support bot features like user preferences or moderation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is part of the public Telegram API and is necessary for the bot to function correctly. No personal identifying information (PII) like names, phone numbers, or profile photos is collected.</p>

  <h2>2. Use of External APIs</h2>
  <p>The Bot may request media from external APIs (such as Pinterest) to generate meme content. These requests are not associated with specific users and are anonymous.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>The Bot may temporarily store chat IDs and user IDs for session or logic purposes (e.g., to avoid spamming or customize replies), but this information is not shared, sold, or stored in external databases.</p>

  <h2>4. Security</h2>
  <p>All data processed by the Bot remains on the server and is handled with minimal retention. No third parties have access to this data.</p>

  <h2>5. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please contact the developer at <strong>fear9579@gmail.com</strong>.</p>

  <p>This bot is a non-commercial, experimental project.</p>
